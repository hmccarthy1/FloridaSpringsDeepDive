The main attraction of this spring is a large observation deck about 15 feet above the water that you can dive off of, straight to the heart of the spring. This spring is one of deepest and most open springs out there, so it's also great for freediving.",

            "springDescription": "This spring is a rare treasure in Florida. It is accessible only through paddling serveral miles up the Withlacoochee River, a river system the branches off into several smaller springs, known as the 'Gum Slough Springs Group'. This paddle is not for the easily deterred, as it is 5 miles up-current, with several areas that you're likely to have to portage your canoe across shallow areas. The head spring at the end of this trip makes it all worthwhile though, as it is a stunning spring that's basically untouched, as the journey to reach it deters tourists and those not familiar with the run. It has some amazing rock formations, and quite a bit of wildlife along the way.",

It's secluded because not people are even aware of it, and it takes quite a bit of work to reach. It's worth the kayak trip thought, as this is one of the most beautiful springs in FL. Stunning rock formations, crystal-clear waters, and plenty of local wildlife makes this spring a must-see for any freedivers looking to hit all of Florida's good spots.",

            "springDescription": "Located in Suwannee County, FL, this lesser-known spring is a great place for those wanting the fun of a florida freshwater spring without the throngs of tourists that some of the more popular springs get. The main attraction of this spring is a large observation deck about 15 feet above the water that you can dive off of, straight to the heart of the spring. This spring is one of deepest and most open springs out there, so it's also great for freediving.",

This makes it a very good spot for freediving, particularly those who want to train to reach greater depths more consistently and improve their breath hold. It also offers a somewhat unique experience, as you can dive off the large platform 20 or so feet above straight into a freedive. As far as snorkeling, there isn't much particularly noteworthy here, but a positive aspect of this spring as a whole is it lesser-known than many of the other springs in the area, which keeps crowds down and the price is free.",

There is a fallen log over the entrance which can make for some extremely cool freediving experiences and shots. Along the way down, there are numerous small side caves and crevices to explore - just be careful not to overdo it. If you're lucky, you can see manatees diving in the springs too!",

There are numerous species of plants and animals to observe along the way, and there are helpful signposts along the way giving you info on various berries, birds, etc. This trail ends linking up to the river that the spring itself feeds in to. There's also a boardwalk along the river leading up to the head spring, culminating in an obsveration deck, but it's close to the center of activity for a very popular spring so there isn't much nature around the boardwalk.",

There's a lot of really cool things you can see from a kayak, but one of the most sought-after sights is manatees swimming up and down the Spring Run. Blue Springs is a protected manatee habitat, and shuts down during the winter months because the manatees seek out the then relatively cool (72 degrees) waters of the spring run, when the water in the river itself is much colder. There are also hundreds of gar to be seen up and down the spring run, but particularly near the mouth where it meets up with the St Johns River, away from the swimmers. There are kayaks, canoes, and stand-up paddleboards available at the shop.",

There are several dive shops who will allow you to do your cert dives here, and it's good to practice for your cavern cert in a safe and relatively risk-free area. If you're lucky, you'll be able to dive alongside some manatees playing in the head spring!",

If you would like more of a traditional experience, there is a head spring at the North Entrance to Ichetucknee with some very cool features to explore. If you're a serious Freediver, you might want to consider Blue Hole. It's a giant underwater cavern, but enough lights shines through the surface entrance that you can swim around a bit near the mouth without having to worry, but the current coming up from the cavern is very strong, so you'll need some powerful legs and a length breath hold to truly enjoy it.",

It's incredibly scenic, with crystal clear waters, plenty of nooks & crannies to explore, and a good amount of wildlife if you're not there at a busy time. The Devil's Spring System is definitely the highlight of Ginnie Springs. It is made up of three different springs: The first is Devil's ear, which is a long, jagged crevass that is about 50 feet deep. It's a great spot for freedivers, as the rocky ledges make great handholds to speed your descent and, and turning upwards once you're at the bottom offers a breathtaking view. The second is Devil's eye, a deep and circular crater-like formation. This formation is a fun place to snorkel, but it really appeals to freedivers and SCUBA divers alike, as the bottom of the formation has slit-like openings that lead into the cave system underneath.  The last is Devil's ear, which is the closest to the Santa Fe river. It has an opening to a cave system at the bottom, but the current is incredibly strong. Devli's ear can commonly become covered with a layer of river water which can occasionally effect visibility.",

The main attraction of this spring is a large observation deck about 15 feet above the water that you can dive off of, straight to the heart of the spring. This spring is one of deepest and most open springs out there, so it's also great for freediving.",

            "springDescription": "This spring is a rare treasure in Florida. It is accessible only through paddling serveral miles up the Withlacoochee River, a river system the branches off into several smaller springs, known as the 'Gum Slough Springs Group'. This paddle is not for the easily deterred, as it is 5 miles up-current, with several areas that you're likely to have to portage your canoe across shallow areas. The head spring at the end of this trip makes it all worthwhile though, as it is a stunning spring that's basically untouched, as the journey to reach it deters tourists and those not familiar with the run. It has some amazing rock formations, and quite a bit of wildlife along the way.",

Stunning rock formations, crystal-clear waters, and plenty of local wildlife makes this spring a must-see for any freedivers looking to hit all of Florida's good spots.",

It's incredibly scenic, with crystal clear waters, plenty of nooks & crannies to explore, and a good amount of wildlife if you're not there at a busy time. The Devil's Spring System is definitely the highlight of Ginnie Springs. It is made up of three different springs: The first is Devil's ear, which is a long, jagged crevass that is about 50 feet deep. It's a great spot for freedivers, as the rocky ledges make great handholds to speed your descent and, and turning upwards once you're at the bottom offers a breathtaking view. The second is Devil's eye, a deep and circular crater-like formation. This formation is a fun place to snorkel, but it really appeals to freedivers and SCUBA divers alike, as the bottom of the formation has slit-like openings that lead into the cave system underneath.  The last is Devil's ear, which is the closest to the Santa Fe river. It has an opening to a cave system at the bottom, but the current is incredibly strong. Devli's ear can commonly become covered with a layer of river water which can occasionally effect visibility.",

# FloridaSpringsDeepDive 
### By Hunter McCarthy

## Why Florida Springs?

I'm an avid freediver and a native Floridian, and I've always loved the natural springs that exist in Florida. There's a lot of really cool activities at most springs - freediving/snorkeling, nature hikes, and tons of really cool wildlife you wouldn't get to see anywhere else. I wanted to leverage my love for Florida springs into a website I can continue to build on as I expand my skill set, and create something that benefits all spring lovers.

## Project Goals

The goal for the creation of this website was to create a one-stop shop where you can get all of your information on Florida springs in one space - What springs there are, where they are, what kind of amenities are available, and of course - how much it costs.I've spent most of my life in Florida, and my love for the springs only grows with time. I want to make sure these same experiences are accesible for everyone, without you having to rely on local knowledge built up over decades. This website should be more than enough to get you all the information you need.

## Contributors 

This was the final project for me in the UCF Coding Boot Camp. You're typically encouraged to work in groups of 4 or 5, but I elected to tackle this task solo as a challenge for myself. All the work here is my own, and I'm going to continue to work on it.

## Features

At the original MVP of this app, there are several available features 

- A database containing 13 of the most popular springs in FL ( I'm continuing to grow it, this was all built in a week and a half )
- For each spring, there are several pictures showing you what you're in for
- For each spring, there's a complete list of all the amenities available at that spring, along with pictures ( camping, hiking, snorkeling, etc.)
- The ability to search by spring name and filter by amenities - for example, if I remember there's multiple "Blue Springs" in Florida but only one has Camping, Hiking, and Tubing, I can perform a search for "Blue Springs" and select those three amenities to find the spring I'm thinking of
- The ability to add/remove springs to a list of favorites
- The ability to give each spring your own personal rating
- The ability to sign up

## Future development 

- As someone who is naturally strong at back-end coding, the design portion of this project was a challenge. It came out passable, but it will require quite a bit of work before it's a top-tier website. I plan on taking some UI/UX classes that will help me improve this
- I plan on adding the ability to post reviews for springs as a whole, and for particular amenities.
- The donate button currently doesn't lead anywhere, I will want to create the ability to donate before pushing it to the public
- Custom sorting depending on your ratings / preferences, for example on my favorites list they should be sorted in descending order based on my rating
